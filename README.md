# Rock Paper Scissors

Bot were made to play against human or another Bot.

## HOW IT WORKS

1. Use 'main.py' to initate your own-bot to play with the designated bot
2. Use 'RPS.py' to design machine learning bot, it uses opponent move history to detect and predict what is the next suitable move
3. Only use 'RPS_game.py' to modify how each bot play
4. 'test_module.py' was included, just in case you want to know how your bot perform to each of other bot
